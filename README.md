# Pythium-induced changes in bacterial and fungal community structure in hydroponically grown lettuce
## Abstract
The composition and structure of plant-associated microbial communities are shaped by both abiotic and biotic factors, with host-related traits and plant-microbe interactions playing key roles. While studies on soil-based cultivation systems have shown that pathogen infection can disrupt plant microbial communities, little is known about how pathogen interactions affect hydroponically grown crops, particularly leafy greens. Despite the controlled conditions of hydroponic cultivation, these systems remain vulnerable to waterborne pathogens like Pythium spp. These oomycetes can rapidly spread through recirculated nutrient solutions and cause severe root diseases. This study aimed to examine how Pythium aphanidermatum inoculation affects the bacterial and fungal communities of hydroponic lettuce under research greenhouse conditions. Our findings indicated that root inoculation with P. aphanidermatum significantly impacted lettuce biomass. Moreover, the bacterial community structure and composition in inoculated roots differed significantly from non-inoculated controls, regardless of disease severity (low and high). In contrast, no significant shifts were observed in fungal community structure. Differential abundance and network analyses identified Pseudomonas and Olpidium as consistently associated with Pythium-inoculated roots. The shifts in microbial composition and structure following Pythium inoculation may indicate dysbiosis and point towards taxa that need to be further explored. A deeper understanding of hydroponics-associated microbial communities, their interactions, and functional roles will allow us to leverage these relationships for improved food security and environmental sustainability. Moreover, understanding the microbial composition dynamics during pathogen infection can have significant implications for disease management and the effective use of biological control agents.
